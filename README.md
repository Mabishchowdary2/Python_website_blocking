* Python_website_blocking
  A handy program that may boost a programmer's productivity by blocking user-specified websites during a certain period of time in a day.


* Language :
   Python 3.6
   
* Usage :
     You can either manually run the Python script in your command line(Windows) or terminal(Linus/Mac), or better yet, simply schedule a daemon and let the script run once the      computer starts. My program is intended to be run (be active) all the time.

    I will recommend using launchd if you're a Mac user, since this allows the process/daemon to run immediately right after you wake up your machine from the sleep mode. Here's a  great tutorial for launchd and it walks you through how to configure the property list on Mac, which is a special XML file.
